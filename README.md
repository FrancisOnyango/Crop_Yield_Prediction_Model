# Crop Yield Prediction Model ðŸŒ¾

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast crop yields and assess food security risks in agriculture. Leveraging data science and statistical analysis, the model will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions for sustainable agriculture and food security.

## Key Objectives
- Predict crop yields based on climatic, soil, and historical yield data.
- Analyze trends in food security and identify regions at high risk of yield shortages.
- Provide data-driven insights for policy development and resource allocation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ggplot2
- **Data Sources**: [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/), [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), and public climate datasets
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Regression analysis, Random Forest, Neural Networks

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- `src/`: Python and R scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `results/`: Outputs from models, including visualizations, metrics, and evaluation reports.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Sources
This project uses multi-source data:
- **FAOSTAT**: Agricultural statistics (yields, crop types)
- **World Bank Open Data**: Socioeconomic indicators
- **Climate Data**: Precipitation, temperature, and humidity levels over time

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources and preprocess it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore the data to understand patterns and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Generate relevant features like soil moisture, precipitation averages, and historical yield trends.
4. **Model Training**: Test multiple models, including Random Forest and Neural Networks, to identify the best model for predicting crop yields.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ², and validate with cross-validation.
6. **Deployment**: Develop a prototype API that allows stakeholders to input data and receive yield predictions.

## Results
- Summarize key findings, such as the most impactful features and the best-performing model.
- Include metrics (RMSE, MAE) and validation results.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the model to include more regions and crop types.
- Integrate a real-time data pipeline for dynamic predictions.
- Collaborate with agronomy experts to fine-tune the model for local contexts.
