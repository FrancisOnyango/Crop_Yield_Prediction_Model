# Crop Yield Prediction Model ðŸŒ¾

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict crop yields, helping stakeholders understand and address food security risks. Using climate, soil, and socioeconomic data, the model provides insights to support agricultural planning and resource allocation.

## Motivation and Background
With climate change impacting agriculture, predicting crop yields is vital for food security. This model leverages data-driven insights to help farmers, policymakers, and researchers make informed decisions.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Provides accurate crop yield predictions based on environmental and economic data.
- **Insights for Food Security**: Identifies regions at high risk of yield shortfalls.

## Project Structure
- **results/plots/**: Contains visualizations generated during data analysis and evaluation.
- **results/metrics/**: Stores model evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- **results/models/**: Includes trained machine learning models for crop yield prediction.
- **results/reports/**: Documentation of findings and recommendations.
